# 👋 Hi, I'm Rachit Sharma

🎯 **Engineer | Machine Learning Developer | Python Toolmaker**

I'm a self-driven developer who builds intelligent systems, automates the boring stuff, and turns ideas into real, working tools. Currently in my final year of IT Engineering and already maintaining two open-source Python libraries used by international developers.

📈 My projects aren’t just for show — they’re used, published, and iterated on. Whether it’s building an AI Butler, solving puzzle games with A*, or detecting fake reviews, I love shipping creative solutions that *actually work*.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🐍 **Python Development** – automation tools, GUIs (Flet, Tkinter), scripts, and libraries
- 🧬 **Machine Learning** – classification, NLP, model evaluation with `scikit-learn`, pandas, etc.
- 🧪 **Research + Experimentation** – AI + cybersecurity, recursive ML refinement
- 🛠️ **Builder Mindset** – I take tools from 0 → GitHub release → international users

## 🧰 Tech Stack

```python
Languages = ["Python", "JavaScript (basic)"]
Frameworks = ["scikit-learn", "Flet", "Tkinter"]
Concepts = ["OOP", AI Agents, ML Ops, GUI apps]
Tools = ["Git", PyInstaller", "VS Code", "PyPI"]
```

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

🔹 [**Fake Review Classifier**](https://github.com/rachits999003/AI-Based-Fake-Review-Classifier)  
Built an ML classifier to detect AI-generated reviews. Uses `RandomForestClassifier` and sentiment features. Achieved 90%+ accuracy on test data. Deployed as a Streamlit demo.  
→ _Used by early testers to evaluate reviews across marketplaces._

🔹 [**Ball Sort Solver**](https://github.com/rachits999003/Ball-Sort-Solver)  
Built a guaranteed solver using A* + custom heuristics. Prunes state trees for faster convergence. GUI made with Tkinter.  
→ _Used by puzzle solvers to crack hard levels without brute force._

## 📦 Python Libraries (Maintainer)

- `pytedit` – Lightweight terminal-based text editor in Python  
- `unitmaster` – Simple and useful unit conversion library that reduces google searches in every program by 90%.
→ _Both have international users and 100+ combined downloads.
