# 👋 Hi, I'm Rachit Sharma

🎯 **Engineer | Machine Learning Developer | Python Toolmaker**

I'm a self-driven developer who builds intelligent systems, automates the boring stuff, and turns ideas into real, working tools. Currently in my final year of IT Engineering and already maintaining two open-source Python libraries used by international developers.

📈 My projects aren’t just for show — they’re used, published, and iterated on. Whether it’s building an AI Butler, solving puzzle games with A*, or detecting fake reviews, I love shipping creative solutions that *actually work*.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🐍 **Python Development** – automation tools, GUIs (Flet, Tkinter), scripts, and libraries
- 🧬 **Machine Learning** – classification, NLP, model evaluation with `scikit-learn`, pandas, etc.
- 🧪 **Research + Experimentation** – AI + cybersecurity, recursive ML refinement
- 🛠️ **Builder Mindset** – I take tools from 0 → GitHub release → international users
